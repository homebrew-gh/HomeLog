- `date` (required): Date of the invoice in MM/DD/YYYY format
- `amount` (optional): Invoice amount (e.g., "$150.00")
- `description` (optional): Brief description of the service

Multiple invoice tags can be present for a single contractor to track service history.

### Service Types

Standard service types include:

### Privacy Note

Invoice files are considered sensitive documents and should only be uploaded to private/trusted media servers. The application enforces this by requiring a private Blossom server to be configured before allowing invoice uploads.

Note: This kind was previously called "Contractor/Service Provider" and has been renamed to "Company/Service Provider" for broader applicability.

## Kind 37005: Company Work Log

A regular event (kind 37005) representing a single record of work done by a company or service provider. Used to log jobs, service visits, and invoices with description, price, completion date (or date range), notes, and optional invoice upload.

### Format

```json
{
  "kind": 37005,
  "content": "<optional encrypted JSON when using encryption>",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "37003:<pubkey>:<company-d-tag>", "", "company"],
    ["company_id", "<company d-tag>"],
    ["alt", "<human-readable description or 'Encrypted Cypher Log company work log'>"],
    ["description", "<brief description of work done>"],
    ["total_price", "<e.g. $150.00>"],
    ["completed_date", "<MM/DD/YYYY>"],
    ["completed_date_start", "<MM/DD/YYYY>"],
    ["completed_date_end", "<MM/DD/YYYY>"],
    ["notes", "<notes>"],
    ["invoice_url", "<url to uploaded invoice>"]
  ]
}
```

When encryption is enabled for the companies category, the event `content` contains NIP-44 encrypted JSON with the same logical fields; only the `alt` and reference tags remain in plaintext.

### Tags

| Tag | Required | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `a` | Yes | Reference to the company (kind 37003) in the form `37003:<pubkey>:<company-d-tag>` |
| `company_id` | Yes | Company d-tag (same as in the `a` tag) |
| `alt` | Yes | Human-readable description (NIP-31) or "Encrypted Cypher Log company work log" when encrypted |
| `description` | Yes (plaintext) / in content (encrypted) | Brief description of the work done |
| `total_price` | No | Total price (e.g., "$150.00") |
| `completed_date` | No* | Single completion date in MM/DD/YYYY when work was done on one day |
| `completed_date_start` | No* | Start of date range in MM/DD/YYYY when work spanned multiple days |
| `completed_date_end` | No* | End of date range in MM/DD/YYYY. Use with `completed_date_start`; mutually exclusive with `completed_date` for a single date. |
| `notes` | No | Additional notes |
| `invoice_url` | No | URL to uploaded invoice/receipt (e.g., from Blossom) |

\* Either `completed_date` or both `completed_date_start` and `completed_date_end` should be provided to indicate when the work was completed.

### Storage

Kind 37005 is a regular event (1000–9999 range). Relays store all events; multiple work log events per company are expected. Clients query by `authors: [pubkey]` and filter or index by `company_id` to show work history per company.

---

## Kind 30229: Maintenance Schedule

An addressable event representing a maintenance schedule for an appliance or vehicle.

### Format

```json
{
  "kind": 30229,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<unique-identifier>"],
    ["alt", "Maintenance schedule: <description>"],
    ["a", "32627:<pubkey>:<appliance-d-tag>", "", "appliance"],
    ["a", "32628:<pubkey>:<vehicle-d-tag>", "", "vehicle"],
    ["a", "37003:<pubkey>:<contractor-d-tag>", "", "contractor"],
    ["description", "<maintenance description>"],
    ["part_number", "<part number>"],
    ["frequency", "<number>"],
    ["frequency_unit", "days|weeks|months|years"],
    ["mileage_interval", "<miles>"],
    ["is_log_only", "true"]
  ]
}
```

### Tags

| Tag | Required | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `d` | Yes | Unique identifier (UUID) for the maintenance schedule |
| `alt` | Yes | Human-readable description (NIP-31) |
| `a` | Conditional | Reference to an appliance (kind 32627), vehicle (kind 32628), or company (kind 37003). At least one appliance, vehicle, or home feature reference is required. Company reference is optional. |
| `description` | Yes | Description of the maintenance task |
| `part_number` | No | Part number for replacement parts |
| `frequency` | Conditional | Numeric frequency value. Required unless `is_log_only` is true. |
| `frequency_unit` | Conditional | Unit of frequency: days, weeks, months, or years. Required unless `is_log_only` is true. |
| `mileage_interval` | No | Mileage interval for vehicle maintenance (e.g., every 5000 miles). Only applicable for scheduled maintenance. |
| `is_log_only` | No | If "true", this is log-only maintenance with no recurring schedule |

### Notes

- Each maintenance schedule references either an appliance OR a vehicle, not both
- Vehicle maintenance can optionally include a mileage interval in addition to time-based frequency
- The `a` tag marker indicates whether the reference is to an "appliance", "vehicle", or "company"
- A company/service provider reference can be optionally added to link the maintenance task to a service provider from the Company/Service tab

### Log-Only Maintenance

Vehicle maintenance supports a "log-only" mode for tasks that don't have a recurring schedule. This is useful for tracking irregular maintenance like:
- Tire rotation when needed
- Brake pad replacement
- Battery replacement
- Window tinting
- Any ad-hoc maintenance

When `is_log_only` is "true":
- The `frequency` and `frequency_unit` tags are omitted
- No due dates are calculated
- The UI displays "Last completed: <date>" instead of a due date
- Users can still record completion events to track when the task was performed

### Due Date Calculation

For scheduled (non-log-only) maintenance, the next due date is calculated by:
1. Taking the `purchase_date` from the referenced appliance (kind 32627) or vehicle (kind 32628) event
2. Adding the maintenance `frequency` × `frequency_unit` to get the first due date
3. For subsequent due dates, continue adding the frequency interval

For example, if an appliance was purchased on 01/15/2024 and has a maintenance frequency of 3 months, the due dates would be:
- 04/15/2024
- 07/15/2024
- 10/15/2024
- etc.

### Encryption (NIP-44)

When the maintenance category has encryption enabled in Cypher Log settings, sensitive data is stored in the `content` field as NIP-44 encrypted JSON. Only structural tags remain in plaintext:

- **Plaintext tags (always):** `d`, `alt`, `a` (appliance/vehicle/company references only). These use UUIDs and do not reveal what is being maintained.
- **Encrypted content (when encryption on):** JSON with `description`, `frequency`, `frequency_unit`, `home_feature`, `part_number`, `parts`, `mileage_interval`, `interval_type`, `isLogOnly`, `isArchived`.

This prevents relay operators from inferring property (e.g. "oil change every 3 months", "HVAC filter") from maintenance events. Legacy events with plaintext tags are still read; new events use encrypted content when encryption is enabled.

---

## Kind 9413: Maintenance Completion

A regular event recording the completion of a maintenance task.

### Format

```json
{
  "kind": 9413,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "30229:<pubkey>:<maintenance-d-tag>", "", "maintenance"],
    ["alt", "Maintenance completed on <MM/DD/YYYY>"],
    ["completed_date", "<MM/DD/YYYY>"]
  ]
}
```

### Tags

| Tag | Required | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `a` | Yes | Reference to the maintenance schedule (kind 30229) this completion is for |
| `alt` | Yes | Human-readable description (NIP-31) |
| `completed_date` | Yes | Date the maintenance was completed in MM/DD/YYYY format |
| `mileage_at_completion` | No | Mileage at time of completion (for vehicle maintenance) |
| `notes` | No | Notes about the completion |

### Notes

- Multiple completion events can exist for a single maintenance schedule, creating a history of when maintenance was performed
- Completion events are regular events (not replaceable) so the full history is preserved
- Completions are displayed chronologically under each maintenance item
- For vehicle maintenance, recording mileage at completion helps track usage-based maintenance intervals

### Encryption (NIP-44)

When the maintenance category has encryption enabled, sensitive completion data is stored in the `content` field as NIP-44 encrypted JSON:

- **Plaintext tags (always):** `a` (reference to maintenance schedule), `alt`. The `a` tag uses the maintenance UUID and does not reveal task details.
- **Encrypted content (when encryption on):** JSON with `completedDate`, `mileageAtCompletion`, `notes`, `parts`.

Legacy events with plaintext tags (`completed_date`, `notes`, `part`, etc.) are still read; new events use encrypted content when encryption is enabled.

---

## Kind 37004: Subscription

An addressable event representing a recurring subscription or service.

### Format

```json
{
  "kind": 37004,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<unique-identifier>"],
    ["alt", "Subscription: <name>"],

| `billing_frequency` | Yes | How often the subscription is billed (see Billing Frequencies below) |
| `company_id` | No | Reference to a Company/Service Provider (d-tag from kind 37003). Mutually exclusive with `company_name`. |
| `company_name` | No | Manual company name entry. Mutually exclusive with `company_id`. |
| `linked_asset_type` | No | Type of linked asset: `appliance`, `vehicle`, or `home_feature` |
| `linked_asset_id` | No | Reference to the linked asset's d-tag (for appliances and vehicles) |
| `linked_asset_name` | No | Name of the linked asset (required for home features, optional for appliances/vehicles) |

### Subscription Types

Standard subscription types include:
- Streaming
- Software
- Health/Wellness
- Shopping
- Vehicle
- Food
- Gaming
- News/Media
- Music
- Home
- Finance
- Pet Care

Custom subscription types can also be used.

### Billing Frequencies

Valid billing frequency values:
- `weekly` - Billed weekly
- `monthly` - Billed monthly
- `quarterly` - Billed every 3 months
- `semi-annually` - Billed every 6 months
- `annually` - Billed yearly
- `one-time` - One-time purchase (not recurring)

### Company Linking

Subscriptions can optionally be linked to a company/service provider in two ways:

1. **By reference** (`company_id`): Links to an existing company from the Companies/Services tab using the company's `d` tag identifier. This creates a two-way relationship where the company card shows active subscriptions.

2. **By name** (`company_name`): Manually entered company name for subscriptions that don't need a full company record.

Only one of `company_id` or `company_name` should be present.

### Asset Linking

Subscriptions can optionally be linked to an asset (appliance, vehicle, or home feature) to organize subscriptions by the items they relate to. This is useful for:

- Warranty service plans linked to specific appliances
- Vehicle service subscriptions (roadside assistance, maintenance plans)
- Home feature service contracts (lawn care, pool maintenance)

The linked asset is defined by three optional tags:

1. **`linked_asset_type`**: The type of asset - `appliance`, `vehicle`, or `home_feature`
2. **`linked_asset_id`**: The d-tag of the linked appliance (kind 32627) or vehicle (kind 32628)
3. **`linked_asset_name`**: The name of the asset for display purposes

For appliances and vehicles, `linked_asset_id` is required. For home features, only `linked_asset_name` is used (since home features are not separate Nostr events).

### Security Warning

The notes field should NOT be used to store login credentials, passwords, or other sensitive authentication information. Users should use a dedicated password manager for storing such data securely.

---

Custom warranty types can also be used.

### Item Linking

Warranties can be linked to assets in the system:

1. **Appliances** (`linked_type: "appliance"`): Links to a My Stuff item (kind 32627)
2. **Vehicles** (`linked_type: "vehicle"`): Links to a Vehicle (kind 32628)
3. **Home Features** (`linked_type: "home_feature"`): Links by name only (no Nostr event)
4. **Custom** (`linked_type: "custom"`): For items not tracked elsewhere

### Extended Warranty Tracking

Warranties support tracking of extended protection plans purchased separately from the manufacturer's warranty. When `has_extended_warranty` is true, the extended warranty fields provide details about the additional coverage.

### Privacy Considerations

Warranty records may contain sensitive information (purchase prices, registration numbers). Users should consider enabling encryption for the "warranties" data category.

    ["sewer_type", "septic|municipal|other"],
    ["notes", "<text>"]
  ]
}
```

When encryption is enabled for projects, the payload is stored in encrypted `content` and only `d` and `alt` are in plaintext.

### Tags

- `dental` - Dental Care
- `grooming` - Grooming
- `emergency` - Emergency
- `follow_up` - Follow-up

### Notes

- Vet visits are regular events (not replaceable) so the full visit history is preserved
- Visits are displayed chronologically under each pet, with most recent first
- Multiple vaccinations can be recorded in a single visit using multiple `vaccination` tags
- The application automatically updates the pet's `last_vet_visit` and optionally `weight` when a new visit is logged
- Follow-up appointments are highlighted in the UI when approaching or overdue
- Vet visits can be deleted using kind 5 deletion events with an `e` tag referencing the visit event ID

### Privacy Considerations

Vet visit records may contain sensitive information about pet health and medical history. All Cypher Log data categories (including pets and vet visits) are encrypted by default on public relays; data on relays marked as private is stored in plaintext on that relay only.

---

## Private Relays and Dual Publish (Cypher Log)

Cypher Log extends standard Nostr usage with **private relays**: relays you mark as private receive **plaintext** copies of your data (for self-hosted or trusted use), while all other relays receive **NIP-44 encrypted** copies. Private relay URLs are stored encrypted in app preferences and are excluded from your public relay list.

### NIP-78: Private Relay List

- The NIP-78 app data event (kind 30078, identifier `cypherlog/preferences`) may include a field **`privateRelays`**.
- When present, `privateRelays` is **NIP-44 encrypted to self** (same pattern as Blossom server URLs). Public relays store the event but cannot read the list.
- Value when decrypted: a JSON array of relay URLs (e.g. `["wss://my.relay.example"]`).
- Only **wss://** URLs are allowed as private; **ws://** URLs are filtered out on load and cannot be marked private in the UI.

### NIP-65: Relay List (Kind 10002)

- When publishing kind 10002, Cypher Log **excludes** any relay that is in the user's private relay list.
- Only "public" relays (relays not in `privateRelays`) are included in the NIP-65 event.
- This keeps private relay URLs out of the public relay list so other clients cannot discover them from NIP-65.

### Relay List Merge and Order

- The full relay list used for reading and writing is: **private relays first**, then public relays (from NIP-65 / app config), deduplicated by URL.
- Private relays are preferred for event fetching so the app can use plaintext when available.

### Dual Publish (Plain to Private, Encrypted to Public)

- When the user has at least one private relay (wss://) and at least one public relay:
  - For addressable/replaceable data that is encrypted, Cypher Log publishes **two** versions of the same logical entity:
    - **Plaintext** version → sent only to private relays.
    - **NIP-44 encrypted** version → sent only to public relays.
  - Same kind, pubkey, d-tag, and created_at; different event IDs.
- When there are no private relays, only the encrypted version is published to the pool (current single-publish behavior).
- When there are only private relays (no public), only the plaintext version is published to those relays.

### Read Path: Deduplication

- Events are deduplicated by **logical key** before parsing:
  - Addressable events: `(kind, pubkey, d-tag)`.
  - Replaceable events: `(kind, pubkey)`.
  - Other kinds: `(kind, pubkey, created_at)` or event id as appropriate.
- When multiple events exist for the same logical key (plain and encrypted copies), the app **prefers plaintext** (content that does not start with the NIP-44 marker) to avoid unnecessary decryption.
- This dedupe runs in the sync/cache layer before domain parsing.

### Delete Path: Sibling Deletion (NIP-09)

- When the user deletes an item, Cypher Log publishes a kind 5 (NIP-09) deletion event.
- To remove **both** the plaintext copy (on private relays) and the encrypted copy (on public relays), the app:
  1. Queries **private** relay set for events with the same (kind, pubkey, d-tag) [or replaceable key].
  2. Queries **public** relay set for the same.
  3. Collects all event IDs from both result sets.
  4. Publishes one kind 5 event with an `e` tag for each of these IDs (and the usual `a` tag for the address), so all copies are requested for deletion.

### WSS-Only Restriction for Private Relays

- A relay can be marked private only if its URL uses **wss://** (secure WebSocket).
- **ws://** URLs cannot be marked private in the UI (switch disabled, with tooltip explaining wss:// is required).
- If stored data ever contains a ws:// URL in the private relay list, it is cleared on load (filtered out) so plaintext is never sent over an unencrypted transport for "private" relays.
